# AWS EC2-VPC Security Group Terraform module

[![Help Contribute to Open Source](https://www.codetriage.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-security-group/badges/users.svg)](https://www.codetriage.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-security-group)

Terraform module which creates [EC2 security group within VPC](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_SecurityGroups.html) on AWS.

These types of resources are supported:

* [EC2-VPC Security Group](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/security_group.html)
* [EC2-VPC Security Group Rule](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/security_group_rule.html)

## Features

This module aims to implement **ALL** combinations of arguments supported by AWS and latest stable version of Terraform:
* IPv4/IPv6 CIDR blocks
* [VPC endpoint prefix lists](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/vpc-endpoints.html) (use data source [aws_prefix_list](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/d/prefix_list.html))
* Access from source security groups
* Access from self
* Named rules ([see the rules here](https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-security-group/blob/master/rules.tf))
* Named groups of rules with ingress (inbound) and egress (outbound) ports open for common scenarios (eg, [ssh](https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-security-group/tree/master/modules/ssh), [http-80](https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-security-group/tree/master/modules/http-80), [mysql](https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-security-group/tree/master/modules/mysql), see the whole list [here](https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-security-group/blob/master/modules/README.md))
* Conditionally create security group and all required security group rules ("single boolean switch").

Ingress and egress rules can be configured in a variety of ways. See [inputs section](#inputs) for all supported arguments and [complete example](https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-security-group/tree/master/examples/complete) for the complete use-case.

## Usage

There are two ways to create security groups using this module:

1. [Specifying predefined rules (HTTP, SSH, etc)](https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-security-group#security-group-with-predefined-rules)
1. [Specifying custom rules](https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-security-group#security-group-with-custom-rules)

### Security group with predefined rules

```hcl
module "web_server_sg" {
  source = "terraform-aws-modules/security-group/aws//modules/http-80"

  name        = "web-server"
  description = "Security group for web-server with HTTP ports open within VPC"
  vpc_id      = "vpc-12345678"

  ingress_cidr_blocks = ["10.10.0.0/16"]
}
```

### Security group with custom rules

```hcl
module "vote_service_sg" {
  source = "terraform-aws-modules/security-group/aws"

  name        = "user-service"
  description = "Security group for user-service with custom ports open within VPC, and PostgreSQL publicly open"
  vpc_id      = "vpc-12345678"

  ingress_cidr_blocks      = ["10.10.0.0/16"]
  ingress_rules            = ["https-443-tcp"]
  ingress_with_cidr_blocks = [
    {
      from_port   = 8080
      to_port     = 8090
      protocol    = "tcp"
      description = "User-service ports"
      cidr_blocks = "10.10.0.0/16"
    },
    {
      rule        = "postgresql-tcp"
      cidr_blocks = "0.0.0.0/0"
    },
  ]
}
```

### Note about "value of 'count' cannot be computed"

Terraform 0.11 has a limitation which does not allow **computed** values inside `count` attribute on resources (issues: [#16712](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16712), [#18015](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/18015), ...)

Computed values are values provided as outputs from `module`. Non-computed values are all others - static values, values referenced as `variable` and from data-sources.

When you need to specify computed value inside security group rule argument you need to specify it using an argument which starts with `computed_` and provide a number of elements in the argument which starts with `number_of_computed_`. See these examples:

```hcl
module "http_sg" {
  source = "terraform-aws-modules/security-group/aws"
  # omitted for brevity
}

module "db_computed_source_sg" {
  # omitted for brevity

  vpc_id = "vpc-12345678" # these are valid values also - "${module.vpc.vpc_id}" and "${local.vpc_id}"

  computed_ingress_with_source_security_group_id = [
    {
      rule                     = "mysql-tcp"
      source_security_group_id = "${module.http_sg.this_security_group_id}"
    }
  ]
  number_of_computed_ingress_with_source_security_group_id = 1
}

module "db_computed_sg" {
  # omitted for brevity

  ingress_cidr_blocks = ["10.10.0.0/16", "${data.aws_security_group.default.id}"]

  computed_ingress_cidr_blocks = ["${module.vpc.vpc_id}"]
  number_of_computed_ingress_cidr_blocks = 1
}

module "db_computed_merged_sg" {
  # omitted for brevity

  computed_ingress_cidr_blocks = ["10.10.0.0/16", "${data.aws_security_group.default.id}", "${module.vpc.vpc_id}"]
  number_of_computed_ingress_cidr_blocks = 3
}
```

Note that `db_computed_sg` and `db_computed_merged_sg` are equal, because it is possible to put both computed and non-computed values in arguments starting with `computed_`.

## Conditional creation

Sometimes you need to have a way to create security group conditionally but Terraform does not allow to use `count` inside `module` block, so the solution is to specify argument `create`.

```hcl
# This security group will not be created
module "vote_service_sg" {
  source = "terraform-aws-modules/security-group/aws"

  create = false
  # ... omitted
}
```

## Examples

* [Complete Security Group example](https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-security-group/tree/master/examples/complete) shows all available parameters to configure security group.
* [HTTP Security Group example](https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-security-group/tree/master/examples/http) shows more applicable security groups for common web-servers.
* [Disable creation of Security Group example](https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-security-group/tree/master/examples/disabled) shows how to disable creation of security group.
* [Dynamic values inside Security Group rules example](https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-security-group/tree/master/examples/dynamic) shows how to specify values inside security group rules (data-sources and variables are allowed).
* [Computed values inside Security Group rules example](https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-security-group/tree/master/examples/computed) shows how to specify computed values inside security group rules (solution for `value of 'count' cannot be computed` problem).

## How to add/update rules/groups?

Rules and groups are defined in [rules.tf](https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-security-group/blob/master/rules.tf). Run `update_groups.sh` when content of that file has changed to recreate content of all automatic modules.

## Known issues

* Due to an [issue #1920](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-aws/issues/1920) in AWS provider, updates to the `description` of security group rules are ignored by this module. If you need to update `description` after the security group has been created you need to recreate security group rule.
